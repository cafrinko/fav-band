    <div class="intro">
      <p>Arlen and Catherine were assigned to make a website about their mutual favorite band, even though they barely know each other and had no idea of each other's music tastes. They named off so many music artists til they felt like they were gonna splode, when finally Arlen had the eureka moment of showing Catherine his playlist. From scrolling down for what seemed like an excessive amount of time, Catherine identified an artist that Arlen seemed to have many albums from, enough to constitute a genuine love of the artist. That artist was The Smashing Pumpkins. The rest is history. The following section lists some of our favorite albums by them.</p>
